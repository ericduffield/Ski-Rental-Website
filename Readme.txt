Hi, Welcome to my website.

Once program is running you can go to any of the following endpoints.

http://localhost:1339/home
http://localhost:1339/get
http://localhost:1339/listSkiEquipment
http://localhost:1339/edit
http://localhost:1339/delete

For ease of access there is a nav bar that have all of these pages if you want to switch between them.

Home lets you add new ski equipment to a database.
Get lets you input the name of a ski equipment and you will get all of it's information.
List lists all the ski equipment in the database.
Edit lets you edit ski equipment in the database by providing the original name and a new name and price.
Delete lets you delete ski equipment from the database with a given name.

Light and dark mode are available for user preference and the menu will become a hamburger dropdown on smaller devices for ease of use on mobile.
